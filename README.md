## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In Colombia there is a Test to measure the educational quality of universities. This test is called Saber-Pro. In the test there are asked socio demographical questions that enable the analysis of the results obtained with information that enable me to create a model that will predict a student result based on different conditions such as the university where he studied of the economical conditions of the student and his family.

The data was gathered from the ICFES oficial page which is the institution responsible for the tests development.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one (1) notebook that has the data cience process and the analysis followed to answer the questions above. This file is named "Capstone.ipynb".

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@andrecezu/analyzing-the-national-bachelor-test-results-in-colombia-339939b5511c).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to ICFES for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle links that appear in the project motivation section.  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
